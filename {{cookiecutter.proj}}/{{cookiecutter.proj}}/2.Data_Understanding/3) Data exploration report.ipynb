    "This task addresses data mining questions using querying, visualization, and reporting techniques. These include distribution of key attributes (for example, the target attribute of a prediction task) relationships between pairs or small numbers of attributes, results of simple aggregations, properties of significant sub-populations, and simple statistical analyses. These analyses may directly address the data mining goals; they may also contribute to or refine the data description and quality reports, and feed into the transformation and other data preparation steps needed for further analysis.\n",
