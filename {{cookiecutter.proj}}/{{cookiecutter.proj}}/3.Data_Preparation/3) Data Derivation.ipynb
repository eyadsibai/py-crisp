There was no reason to have such records in the raw data, but for modeling purposes it might make sense to explicitly represent the fact that certain customers made zero purchases."

    "## Merged data\n",
    "Merging tables refers to joining together two or more tables that have different information about the same objects. Example: a retail chain has one table with information about each storeâ€™s general characteristics (e.g., floor space, type of mall), another table with summarized sales data (e.g., profit, percent change in sales from previous year), and another with information about the demographics of the surrounding area. Each of these tables contains one record for each store. These tables can be merged together into a new table with one record for each store, combining fields from the source tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merged data also covers aggregations. Aggregation refers to operations in which new values are computed by summarizing information from multiple records and/or tables. For example, converting a table of customer purchases where there is one record for each purchase into a new table where there is one record for each customer, with fields such as number of purchases, average purchase amount, percent of orders charged to credit card, percent of items under promotion, etc."

    "# Format data\n",
    "Formatting transformations refer to primarily syntactic modifications made to the data that do not change its meaning, but might be required by the modeling tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reformatted data\n",
    "Some tools have requirements on the order of the attributes, such as the first field being a unique identifier for each record or the last field being the outcome field the model is to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be important to change the order of the records in the dataset. Perhaps the modeling tool requires that the records be sorted according to the value of the outcome attribute. Commonly, records of the dataset are initially ordered in some way, but the modeling algorithm needs them to be in a fairly random order. For example, when using neural networks, it is generally best for the records to be presented in a random order, although some tools handle this automatically without explicit user intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there are purely syntactic changes made to satisfy the requirements of the specific modeling tool. Examples: removing commas from within text fields in comma-delimited data files, trimming all values to a maximum of 32 characters."
